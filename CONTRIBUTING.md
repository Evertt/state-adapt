Thanks for your interest in contributing to StateAdapt!

For now, submit an issue, whether it's for a question, a bug, or a feature request. I will get to it as soon as I can.

If there start to be too many issues for me to keep up with, I'll update this document. For now, it seems like a waste of time working on this documentation when I have plenty of time to get everything done myself.
